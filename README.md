# CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning

This project is part of the SmartInternz internship program. It uses **transfer learning** with **VGG16** to classify waste images into categories such as:
- Biodegradable
- Recyclable
- Trash

## 💡 Problem Statement
Improper waste disposal affects the environment and public health. This project aims to automate the classification of waste materials using AI to assist in smarter recycling and segregation.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras (VGG16 model)
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)

## 🚀 Features
- Web-based user interface to upload waste images
- Image classification using trained VGG16 model
- Displays prediction result with confidence
- Modern UI with blog and portfolio sections
